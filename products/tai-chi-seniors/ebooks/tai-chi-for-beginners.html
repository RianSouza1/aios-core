    <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
    <h1>Chapter 1: What Is Tai Chi?</h1>

    <p>Tai Chi (often written as "Tai Chi Chuan" or "Taijiquan") is an ancient Chinese practice that combines slow,
        deliberate movements with deep breathing and mental focus. While it originated as a martial art, today it is
        practiced worldwide primarily for its health benefits, stress reduction, and meditative qualities.</p>

    <p>If you've ever seen a group of people moving slowly and gracefully in a park — arms flowing, weight shifting,
        each movement blending smoothly into the next — you've witnessed Tai Chi in action. It looks simple, even
        effortless. But within that simplicity lies a profound system for improving your physical and mental well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>Tai Chi Is for Everyone</h2>

    <p>One of the most beautiful things about Tai Chi is that it meets you wherever you are. Whether you're 25 or 85,
        athletic or sedentary, flexible or stiff — Tai Chi can be adapted to your body and ability level. There is no
        such thing as being "too old," "too inflexible," or "too unfit" for Tai Chi.</p>

    <p>Unlike many forms of exercise, Tai Chi has:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No impact:</strong> Your feet stay close to the ground, eliminating stress on joints</li>
        <li><strong>No equipment:</strong> You can practice anywhere with a small open space</li>
        <li><strong>No competition:</strong> The only person you're working with is yourself</li>
        <li><strong>No forcing:</strong> Every movement should feel comfortable and controlled</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> Tai Chi is not about perfection. It's about presence. If you can breathe and move,
        you can practice Tai Chi.
    </div>

    <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 2: A Brief History & Philosophy</h1>

    <p>Understanding the roots of Tai Chi will deepen your practice and give you a richer appreciation for what you're
        learning. You don't need to memorize these details — just let them provide context and inspiration.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Tai Chi originated in China during the 12th-17th centuries. While its exact origins are debated by historians,
        the most widely accepted story attributes its creation to a Taoist monk named Zhang Sanfeng. According to
        legend, Zhang observed a fight between a crane and a snake, noticing how the snake's yielding, circular
        movements deflected the crane's direct attacks. Inspired by this, he developed a martial art based on softness
        overcoming hardness.</p>

    <h2>The Five Major Styles</h2>
    <p>Over the centuries, Tai Chi evolved into five main family styles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yang Style:</strong> The most popular and widely practiced. Known for its large, graceful, expansive
            movements. This is the style used in this book.</li>
        <li><strong>Chen Style:</strong> The oldest style, featuring a mix of slow movements and explosive bursts. More
            physically demanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Wu Style:</strong> Characterized by smaller, more compact movements. Excellent for developing
            internal strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun Style:</strong> Known as the most gentle style, featuring high stances and agile footwork.
            Popular among seniors.</li>
        <li><strong>Wu/Hao Style:</strong> A rare style focusing on internal energy development with very small, subtle
            movements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Philosophy of Yin & Yang</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Tai Chi is the ancient Chinese concept of Yin and Yang — the idea that all things exist as
        complementary opposites. In Tai Chi, every movement embodies this duality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When one hand rises (Yang), the other lowers (Yin)</li>
        <li>As you shift forward, you prepare to shift back</li>
        <li>As you inhale (expanding), you prepare to exhale (contracting)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This constant flow between opposites creates the harmony and balance that makes Tai Chi so distinctive and
        effective.</p>

    <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 3: The Core Principles of Tai Chi</h1>

    <p>Before learning specific movements, it helps to understand the core principles that guide all Tai Chi practice.
        These principles apply to every movement you'll learn.</p>

    <h2>1. Relax (Song)</h2>
    <p>The most important principle in Tai Chi is relaxation — but not limpness. "Song" means releasing unnecessary
        tension while maintaining structure. Your muscles should be engaged enough to support your body, but never
        tense, stiff, or clenched. Think of a cat at rest: relaxed yet ready to move instantly.</p>

    <h2>2. Slowness (Man)</h2>
    <p>Every movement in Tai Chi is performed slowly and deliberately. Slowness allows you to feel what your body is
        doing, maintain control, and develop the mind-body connection that makes Tai Chi so powerful. A good guideline:
        if you can go slower, you should.</p>

    <h2>3. Continuity (Lian Xu)</h2>
    <p>Tai Chi movements flow continuously from one to the next, like water in a stream. There are no abrupt starts or
        stops. Even when you pause, the energy continues. This continuous quality is what gives Tai Chi its
        characteristic grace.</p>

    <h2>4. Rootedness (Gen)</h2>
    <p>Your connection to the ground is fundamental. Imagine your feet growing roots into the earth, providing a stable
        base from which all movement originates. The lower your stance (within comfort), the more rooted and stable
        you'll feel.</p>

    <h2>5. Intention (Yi)</h2>
    <p>In Tai Chi, the mind leads the body. Before your hand moves, your mind has already traveled to its destination.
        This principle — "Yi leads Qi (energy), Qi leads Li (force)" — means that mental focus should always precede
        physical action.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <strong>Practical Tip:</strong> You don't need to master all five principles at once. Focus on relaxation first.
        As that becomes natural, gradually incorporate the others. Mastery comes from years of practice — enjoy the
        journey.
    </div>

    <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 4: Basic Stances & Postures</h1>

    <p>Every Tai Chi movement begins and ends with a stance. Learning these fundamental postures will give you the
        physical vocabulary you need for all future movements.</p>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Stance 1: Wuji (Starting Position)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand with feet parallel, shoulder-width apart.</li>
            <li>Knees slightly bent (about 2 inches).</li>
            <li>Tailbone tucked slightly under. Imagine your spine as a straight column.</li>
            <li>Shoulders relaxed and dropped. Arms hang naturally at your sides, fingers relaxed.</li>
            <li>Chin slightly tucked in. Imagine the top of your head being pulled gently upward by a string.</li>
            <li>Eyes look forward softly — not focused on anything specific.</li>
            <li>Breathe naturally. Stand for 1-3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Stance 2: Bow Stance (Gong Bu)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From Wuji, step forward with your left foot about one shoulder-width ahead.</li>
            <li>Bend your front (left) knee so it tracks over your toes. Keep your back leg straight but not locked.
            </li>
            <li>About 70% of your weight is on the front leg, 30% on the back leg.</li>
            <li>Both feet point forward (back foot can angle out up to 45 degrees).</li>
            <li>Hips face forward. Upper body stays upright and centered.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Stance 3: Empty Stance (Xu Bu)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From Wuji, shift your weight entirely onto your right leg.</li>
            <li>Touch your left toes lightly on the ground in front of you — carrying no weight.</li>
            <li>Your right leg bears 100% of your weight, knee bent.</li>
            <li>This stance develops balance and control. Hold for 5-10 seconds per side.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Stance 4: Horse Stance (Ma Bu)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width, toes pointing slightly outward.</li>
            <li>Bend both knees equally, as if sitting on a horse (or a high stool).</li>
            <li>Weight is distributed evenly 50/50 between both legs.</li>
            <li>Back is straight, tailbone tucked under. Hands can rest on thighs or hold in front of the body.</li>
            <li>Start by holding for 30 seconds. Gradually increase to 2-3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Practice transitioning between these stances slowly and smoothly. This alone is an excellent daily exercise that
        builds leg strength, balance, and body awareness.</p>

    <!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 5: Your First Movements</h1>

    <p>Now that you know the stances, it's time to add movement. These are the simplest, most foundational Tai Chi
        movements. Master these, and you'll have the building blocks for any Tai Chi form.</p>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Movement 1: Opening Form (Qi Shi)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin in Wuji stance.</li>
            <li>Inhale: slowly raise both arms in front of you to shoulder height, palms facing down. Move as if you're
                lifting your arms through water.</li>
            <li>Exhale: gently bend your knees a bit deeper while lowering your arms back to your sides.</li>
            <li>Repeat 8-10 times.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Movement 2: Ward Off (Peng)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From Wuji, shift your weight to your right leg.</li>
            <li>Step forward with your left foot into a Bow Stance.</li>
            <li>As you step, raise your left arm in front of your chest, palm facing inward, as if holding a large ball
                against your chest.</li>
            <li>Your right hand lowers to your right hip, palm facing down.</li>
            <li>Hold for a moment, then step back and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>This is the most fundamental defensive posture in Tai Chi.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Movement 3: Roll Back (Lu)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Ward Off position, turn your waist slightly to the right.</li>
            <li>As you turn, your left hand rotates palm-up and draws back toward your right shoulder, as if redirecting
                an incoming force.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously shift your weight from front to back leg.</li>
            <li>This movement teaches you the Tai Chi principle of "yielding" — using softness to redirect force.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Movement 4: Press (Ji)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>From Roll Back, shift your weight forward again into the Bow Stance.</li>
            <li>Bring both hands together in front of your chest: left palm pressing against the back of your right
                wrist.</li>
            <li>As you shift forward, gently press both hands away from your body at chest height.</li>
            <li>This movement combines two hands into one coordinated action.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
        <strong>Note:</strong> These four movements — Opening Form, Ward Off, Roll Back, and Press — are known as the
        "Four Cardinal Techniques" of Tai Chi. They appear in virtually every Tai Chi form. Master these, and you'll
        feel at home in any Tai Chi class.

    <!-- CHAPTER 6 -->
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <h1>Chapter 6: 7-Day Starter Routine</h1>

    <p>This routine is designed to ease you into a daily Tai Chi practice over one week. Each day builds on the previous
        one. By Day 7, you'll have a complete 12-minute routine you can repeat indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>Day 1: Breathe & Stand (5 minutes)</h2>
    <ul>

    <h1>Chapter 7: Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them</h1>

    <p>Every beginner makes mistakes — it's a natural part of learning. Here are the most common ones and how to correct
        them.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 1: Moving Too Fast</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Many beginners rush through movements, trying to "get them right" quickly. This
        defeats the purpose of Tai Chi.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Set a mental speed limit. Imagine you're moving through thick honey. If a movement
        takes you 3 seconds, try to stretch it to 6. True Tai Chi is almost always slower than you think.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 2: Holding Your Breath</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> When concentrating on new movements, many beginners unknowingly hold their breath
        or breathe shallowly.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> If you can't coordinate your breath with movements yet, that's fine — just breathe
        naturally. Never hold your breath. The coordination will develop over time.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 3: Locking Your Knees</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Straightening the legs completely puts stress on the knee joints and removes the
        "rooted" quality from your stance.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Keep a slight bend in your knees at all times — even when standing "straight." Think of
        your knees as shock absorbers.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 4: Leaning Forward</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Beginners often lean their upper body forward when stepping or reaching, which
        compromises balance.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Keep your spine vertical. Imagine a plumb line from the top of your head straight down
        to the ground between your feet. All movement happens below the waist; your upper body stays upright.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 5: Tensing the Shoulders</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Stress lives in the shoulders. Many beginners unconsciously raise their shoulders
        toward their ears during practice.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> At least once every minute, do a quick check: are your shoulders down and relaxed? If
        not, exhale and let them drop. Over time, relaxed shoulders will become your default.</p>

    <h2>Mistake 6: Seeking Perfection Too Early</h2>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Comparing yourself to experienced practitioners or worrying about getting every
        detail right can create frustration and discourage practice.</p>
    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Embrace the beginner's mindset. In Tai Chi, there is a saying: "A journey of a thousand
        miles begins with a single step." Every master was once a beginner who simply kept showing up. Focus on
        consistency, not perfection.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <strong>Final Thought:</strong> The fact that you've started this journey is the most important step. Keep
        coming back to these pages, keep practicing, and let Tai Chi transform your body and mind — one gentle movement
        at a time.
